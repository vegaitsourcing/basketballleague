Website development for a Recreational Basketball League Liga za rekreativce  Basketball recreationists league is aimed at everyone interested in playing basketball within one organized competition, except for those who play basketball professionally and who are actively involved in playing basketball in one of the clubs. As the league is getting bigger, it would be great to have a website that would include both the information about the current basketball season and the information about the matches played so far. Also, it should include the data about all the players who have been playing in the League so far, as well as the statistics, that is, the playersâ€™ performance.
